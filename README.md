#todos (what's happening)


1 - after triggering box collider which i have placce under grid(tile pallates)
    i   - Under grid
		ii  - WallBoarder
    ii  - Grass
    iv  - HighGround
    v   - HighGroundGrass
    vi  - HighGroound-LessColider (here i have place 4 box collider to trigger for my player to enter HighGround)
			
2 - after trigger box collider which i have place in HighGroound-LessCollider - which will run a script (it will change the sortinglayer of player to 20-which is highest on Game)



### What actually i want to happen ###
1 - Since Script is working for Player (sortingLayer = 20) - still Player is colliding with other boxCollider


Thanks in Advance (Appericated)
